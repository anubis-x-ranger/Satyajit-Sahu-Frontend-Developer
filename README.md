## Problem Statement
Technical Assignment | Frontend Developer
Build React app to share SpaceX data with the world.

About the SpaceX
https://www.spacex.com designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.
They have open-sourced their data through https://docs.spacexdata.com/

About the assignment
Build a landing page using React to display Rockets or Capsules. Feel free to choose what interests you most.
Build authorized REST API to fetch & send data in between SpaceX & your app. There will be bonus points if you use PHP for authorization REST API.
Donâ€™t use any PHP framework
A good-looking, pixel-perfect design for the landing page will showcase the design skills. Here are a few high-level design ideas, or you can choose your own design.

Page must have three main sections: Banner, search form, and data grid.
For the banner
A modern banner layout that shows your UI skills
For the search form
Having three search filters would be excellent. Example: User can search Capsules by status, original_launch, and type
Deliver a good user experience
Fully functional search form without bugs
Optimized search query to deliver quick results
For the data grid
Elegant design
Display the right amount of data
Paginate the data grid, for example, shows ten items per page.
When clicking on the item, it should display the item data in the popup
The design needs to be responsive for all screen sizes and different browsers
React app should have optimized query so that it will load fast.
Use of Semantic HTML & SEO best practices is appreciated
Creating test cases for the code is not required, but it will take your assignment to another level.
